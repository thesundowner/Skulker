# Skulker Readme

NOTE: the dates of the commit and releases are messed up. i am lazy to compile a release everytime because i forgot to print a variable. So i made a `setup.py` file that will do the compilation. 
1. Clone the Project
2. Download Python 3.11.5 (idk but you can use the latest version)
3. go to the project folder and open up a terminal window
4. run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. wait
6. Download UPX
7. Download and install Inno Setup Wizard (optional)
8. run `setup.py`
9. go to `dists` and run the application.
