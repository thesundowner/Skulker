# Skulker - a Steghide-like application
## What it does
Skulker is a program that let's you hide secret messages in plainsight in JPEG files(photos). The program won't alter the image at all in any way, so your precious family photos are safe (if you ever have a reason why you'd want a secret text in your family picture in the first place).
Besides text, you can hide other files as well. Want to stash your tax records so that the IRS won't find it? sure, no one would ever thought you'll hide it inside of the picures of your cat.
If you're familiar with Steghide, you'll know what this application does. But the diffrerence in Skulker is it directly appends the data. no algorithms.
